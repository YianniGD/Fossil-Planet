Project Context and Code Standards for "Fossil Planet"This document provides essential context and rules for the Gemini Code Assist model to ensure all generated code and documentation adhere to the "Fossil Planet" project standards.1. Project Overview and PurposeProject Name: Fossil PlanetGoal: A highly visual and interactive web application for exploring prehistoric species, their fossil locations, and geological time periods. The app is built as an educational encyclopedia with game-like elements.Core Interactive Features (High Priority - Do Not Break):D3.js Globe (Globe.jsx): An interactive globe that visualizes species and dig sites. This is a complex D3.js integration within React.Timeline (Timeline.jsx): A visual, scrollable timeline of geological eras and epochs.Digging Game (DiggingGame.jsx): An interactive game for users to "find" fossils.Species Encyclopedia (SpeciesPage.jsx): Detailed pages for each species, displaying images (main, skeleton, icon), descriptions, and stats.2. Technical Stack and DependenciesAll code generation must strictly adhere to this stack.LayerTechnologyKey Libraries / NotesFrontendReactUse Functional Components with hooks. No class components.LanguageJavaScript (JSX)The project uses .jsx and .js files, not TypeScript.Build ToolViteAs configured in vite.config.js.VisualizationD3.js (d3.v7.min.js)This is a core dependency, especially for Globe.jsx. Code must respect D3's data-binding and DOM manipulation patterns within the React lifecycle (e.g., using useEffect and useRef).StylingStandard CSSThis is NOT a Tailwind project. Styling is done via imported .css files (e.g., src/css/style.css, src/css/Timeline.css). Do not generate Tailwind utility classes.DataStatic JSON FilesAll application data is loaded from static .json files in the /data/ and /json/ directories (e.g., species_index_full.json). Do not invent or suggest external APIs.3. Code Style and Architectural PatternsComponent Naming: Components are PascalCase (e.g., SpeciesPage.jsx, FilterControls.jsx).Data Loading: Data is loaded from static JSON files using fetch (e.g., fetch('/json/timeline.json')).Asset Paths: All static assets (images, audio, etc.) are in the /public/ directory. Paths in code must be root-relative.Species Icons: /animals/icons/[SpeciesName]icon.webpSpecies Main Art: /animals/main/[SpeciesName].webpSpecies Skeletons: /animals/skeleton/[SpeciesName]_skeleton.webpStyling: When creating a new component, it should import its own dedicated CSS file (e.g., NewComponent.jsx should import src/css/NewComponent.css).4. Gemini Code Assist Operational Directives (MANDATORY)These are strict rules for how you must operate within this project.Feature Protection (CRITICAL): Under no circumstances should generated or refactored code remove, disable, or simplify existing features, components, or interactive logic. The primary directive is to preserve all existing functionality. Be especially careful with the D3.js logic in Globe.jsx and the Timeline in Timeline.jsx.File Content Exclusions (Performance): To improve performance and focus on relevant code, DO NOT parse, index, or read the contents of the following large JSON files when diagnosing errors, unless explicitly asked to inspect them:/json/species_index_full.json/json/bg.json/json/fg.jsonYou should assume these files are structurally correct and that the data they provide is valid. Focus debugging efforts on the component logic (.jsx files) that consumes this data.Edit Confirmation (Agent Mode): When operating in "agent mode" or performing any complex, multi-file refactor, you MUST ALWAYS ask for explicit user confirmation before applying any edit. Do not make any changes, no matter how small, without approval.Shell Command Execution (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN):You are not permitted to run any shell or terminal commands (npm install, npm run dev, git commit, python update_icon_property.py, etc.).You must instead output the exact command string and REQUEST the user to execute it in their own terminal.If the user explicitly declines to run the command (e.g., says "no" or "not now"), you must immediately halt the related operation and explain that you cannot proceed without the command being run. Do not attempt to run it yourself or ask again.
